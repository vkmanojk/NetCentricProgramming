            <span>The Inlaks Foundation was established in 1976 by Indoo Shivdasani to incorporate his existing philanthropic activities and to provide a permanent, independent body for the expansion of these activities. The Foundation has now been renamed the Inlaks Shivdasani Foundation.

                The Foundation focuses on providing scholarships, grants and awards in various fields to outstanding young Indians to enable them to develop their professional, scientific, artistic and cultural abilities, both abroad and in India. It prides itself on being open to a wide range of subjects, many of which are not covered by other fund-giving bodies. Over the last four decades, more than 460 scholars have benefited from overseas scholarships while over 600 others have received awards and Take-Off Grants in India and abroad. Opportunities in India are offered through the Inlaks India Foundation. 
                
                The list of Inlaks alumni reflects the diversity of scholars that the Foundation has supported. Today many are leaders in their chosen fields the world over.
                
                The key to the Inlaks approach is recognising and honouring individual talent. The Foundation looks for the unusual, searches out the special and spots people with promise. And once convinced, the Foundation does everything possible to encourage the candidate.
                
                In 2008, the Foundation instituted the Inlaks Research and Travel Grant to enable registered PhD students of Indian universities to undertake short-term visits to institutions abroad to collect material, use facilities and consult experts.
