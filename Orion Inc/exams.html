In another change, the exam is now conducted in computer based mode (except the drawing section of Paper 2 (B.Arch) which is a pen and paper based exam). JEE Main is the admission procedure into the well-known IIITs, NITs and other more prestigious engineering institutes of the nation. More than 12 lakh applicants appear for this examination hoping to clear and reach JEE Advanced for admissions. The duration of the exam is 3 hours long and is multiple choice in nature. The examination is divided into two papers – Paper 1 is for B.Tech/B.E and Paper 2 is for B.Arch or B.Planning.
